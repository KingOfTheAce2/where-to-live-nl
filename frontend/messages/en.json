        "description": "The Leefbaarometer is an official Dutch government index that measures quality of life across all neighborhoods. It combines 100+ indicators including safety, housing quality, social cohesion, and access to facilities into a single score from 1 (very poor) to 5 (excellent).",
        "whyMatters": "This is the most comprehensive quality-of-life indicator available. A score below 3 indicates areas with challenges. The score is updated every 2 years based on resident surveys and official statistics. It's widely used by Dutch people when choosing where to live."
      },
      "airQuality": {
        "title": "Air Quality",
        "description": "Shows concentrations of harmful pollutants including NO₂ (nitrogen dioxide from traffic), PM10 (coarse particles), and PM2.5 (fine particles that penetrate deep into lungs). Data comes from RIVM monitoring stations and atmospheric modeling.",
        "whyMatters": "Air pollution significantly impacts health, especially for children, elderly, and people with respiratory conditions. Areas near highways, airports, and industrial zones typically have worse air quality. The Netherlands has relatively high pollution levels compared to other European countries."
      },
      "noise": {
        "title": "Noise Pollution",
        "description": "Displays noise levels in decibels (dB) from different sources: road traffic, railways, and aircraft. The Lden metric represents a 24-hour average where evening and night noise is weighted more heavily because it's more disturbing.",
        "whyMatters": "Chronic noise exposure above 55 dB increases stress and cardiovascular disease risk. Areas near Schiphol, highways, and train lines have significant noise. This affects property values, sleep quality, and overall wellbeing. Check this before renting or buying near infrastructure."
      },
      "crime": {
        "title": "Crime Statistics",
        "description": "Crime data from the Dutch Police (Politie) showing reported incidents per 1,000 residents. Includes theft, burglary, violence, and vandalism. The national average is approximately 50 incidents per 1,000 residents.",
        "whyMatters": "Crime rates vary significantly between neighborhoods, even within the same city. City centers and certain suburban areas typically have higher rates. Low crime correlates with higher livability scores. Consider both the rate and types of crime when evaluating an area."
      },
      "flooding": {
        "title": "Flood Risk",
        "description": "Shows areas at risk of flooding from rivers, sea, or heavy rainfall. The Netherlands is famously low-lying, with 26% of the country below sea level. The map shows potential water depth in worst-case scenarios (dike breach or extreme weather).",
        "whyMatters": "While Dutch flood defenses are world-class, risk isn't zero. Flood risk affects insurance costs and could impact basement usage. Properties in risk zones may face restrictions. Climate change is increasing rainfall intensity. Always check evacuation routes if you live in a risk area."
      },
      "foundationRisk": {
        "title": "Foundation Risk",
        "description": "Identifies areas where buildings may have foundation problems due to subsiding soil. Particularly relevant for older buildings (pre-1970) with wooden pile foundations in clay or peat soil areas, common in western Netherlands.",
        "whyMatters": "Foundation problems are extremely expensive to fix (€50,000-€150,000+) and are NOT covered by standard insurance. Sellers are not legally required to disclose issues. Budget €1,000-1,500 for a professional foundation inspection (bouwkundig rapport) before buying any pre-1970 property in risk areas."

        "title": "Natura 2000 Protected Areas",
        "description": "Natura 2000 is the European Union's network of protected nature areas. The Netherlands has 162 Natura 2000 sites covering about 14% of land and water. These include dunes, heathlands, forests, and wetlands with strict environmental protections.",
        "whyMatters": "Living near Natura 2000 areas means access to pristine nature for hiking and recreation. However, there are strict regulations: you cannot build or renovate freely near these areas, and nitrogen emissions restrictions may limit activities. It's great for nature lovers but check local rules before buying."
      },
      "nationalParks": {
        "title": "National Parks",
        "description": "The Netherlands has 21 national parks covering unique landscapes including the Wadden Sea, Veluwe forests, dunes, and wetlands. These are designated for nature conservation and public recreation.",
        "whyMatters": "National parks offer exceptional outdoor recreation opportunities: hiking, cycling, wildlife watching. Properties near parks often have premium values. However, similar to Natura 2000, there may be building restrictions and environmental regulations in surrounding areas."
      },
      "droneNoFly": {
        "title": "Drone No-Fly Zones",
        "description": "Areas where drone flight is restricted or prohibited. Includes airports, military installations, royal palaces, prisons, and nature reserves. Managed by LVNL (Air Traffic Control Netherlands).",
        "whyMatters": "If you're a drone hobbyist, check these zones before choosing a location. No-fly zones can be quite large around airports. This map also indicates proximity to sensitive infrastructure like airports and military bases which may affect noise levels and property values."
      },
      "cadastral": {
        "title": "Cadastral Parcels",
        "description": "Shows official property boundaries as registered with the Kadaster (Dutch Land Registry). Each parcel has a unique identifier and legally defined boundaries. The Kadaster was established in 1832 and maintains precise records of all land ownership.",
        "whyMatters": "Essential when buying property to understand exact boundaries. Disputes over property lines can be expensive to resolve. The cadastral map shows whether boundaries are definitively surveyed or provisional. You can request official boundary documents from the Kadaster for a fee."
      },
      "neighborhoods": {
        "title": "Neighborhood Boundaries",
        "description": "Shows official CBS (Statistics Netherlands) neighborhood ('buurt') and district ('wijk') boundaries. The Netherlands is divided into approximately 17,000 neighborhoods. All government statistics are reported at this level.",
        "whyMatters": "Understanding neighborhood boundaries helps you search for relevant statistics and compare areas accurately. Property prices, crime rates, and livability scores are typically reported per neighborhood. Adjacent streets can have very different statistics if they're in different official neighborhoods."

        "whyMatters": "For families, proximity to schools is crucial. Dutch children typically walk or cycle to school independently. International schools are concentrated in major cities. School quality varies and parents should research specific schools. The catchment area for popular schools can be very small."
      },
      "healthcare": {
        "title": "Healthcare Facilities",
        "description": "Shows locations of huisartsen (GPs), pharmacies, hospitals, and specialist clinics. In the Dutch system, your huisarts is your first point of contact for all healthcare and provides referrals to specialists.",
        "whyMatters": "Everyone in the Netherlands must register with a local huisarts. Popular practices in cities often have waiting lists. Having a hospital nearby matters for emergencies. Pharmacies are less common than in some countries - most are in shopping areas or attached to GP practices."
      },
      "supermarkets": {
        "title": "Supermarkets",
        "description": "Major grocery stores including Albert Heijn, Jumbo, Lidl, Aldi, Plus, and specialty stores. Most Dutch supermarkets are smaller than American or UK equivalents and are found in neighborhood centers.",
        "whyMatters": "Daily shopping is common in the Netherlands - people often visit supermarkets multiple times per week. Most Dutch cycle to the store. Having a supermarket within cycling distance significantly impacts daily convenience. Some villages only have small shops with limited selection."
      },
      "trainStations": {
        "title": "Train Stations (NS)",
        "description": "Dutch Railways (NS) stations including Intercity and local (Sprinter) stops. The Netherlands has one of Europe's densest rail networks. Intercity trains connect major cities every 10-15 minutes.",
        "whyMatters": "Train commuting is extremely common. Living near an Intercity station provides fast connections across the country. Station proximity significantly affects property values. Consider both the station and frequency of trains to your workplace. Rural stations may have limited service."
      },
      "publicTransport": {
        "title": "Metro and Tram",
        "description": "Metro systems exist in Amsterdam and Rotterdam. Tram networks operate in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, and Utrecht. These provide frequent urban transport complementing the train network.",
        "whyMatters": "In major cities, tram and metro access can be more important than train stations for daily commuting. Lines and stops affect property values. Tram tracks can mean noise, but excellent connections. Metro provides fast cross-city travel in Amsterdam and Rotterdam."
      },
      "playgrounds": {
        "title": "Playgrounds",
        "description": "Public playgrounds (speeltuinen) maintained by municipalities. Dutch neighborhoods typically have well-maintained play areas for children. Data sourced from municipal records and OpenStreetMap.",
        "whyMatters": "For families with young children, nearby playgrounds are essential for daily life. Dutch children spend significant time outdoors. Quality and equipment varies - visit in person to assess. Some playgrounds have age restrictions or membership requirements."
