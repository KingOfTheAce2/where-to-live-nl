## Market Context

### Competitor Analysis

#### Location Intelligence & Buying Assistance

| Service | Price | What You Get | Limitations |
|---------|-------|--------------|-------------|
| **Real Estate Agent** | 1.15% of purchase + €350-750 startup | Full guidance, bidding advice, negotiations | Expensive, conflict of interest |
| **Walter Living** | €29/month | Bidding insights, valuation reports, viewing support | Transaction data only, no location intelligence |
| **Homeup** | Fixed fee (varies) | Personal buying service, exclusive properties | Limited to their portfolio |
| **Huispedia/Huizenpedia** | Free | Market data, price trends, community reviews | No risk assessment, limited analysis |
| **Huizenzoeker.nl** | Free | Price trend analysis, aggregated listings | No location intelligence |
| **Where-to-Live-NL** | See below | Location intelligence, risk assessment, livability | No bidding/transaction data (yet) |

#### Property Listing Platforms (No Intelligence)

| Service | Price | What You Get | Limitations |
|---------|-------|--------------|-------------|
| **Funda** | Free (ad-supported) | Largest listing database, NVM agents | No intelligence, no risk data |
| **Pararius** | Free | Rental-focused, some sales | Rental primary, basic filters |
| **Jaap.nl** | Free | Wide range, similar to Funda | No analytics, no insights |
| **Huislijn.nl** | Free | Agent + private listings | Basic search only |
| **WoningNet** | Free | Social housing via associations | Income-qualified only |
| **Marktplaats** | Free | Unique private listings | No quality control, risky |
| **Makelaarsland** | Fixed fee | Sell-it-yourself platform | Sellers only |
| **RE/MAX** | Free | International network | Limited NL-specific insights |
| **VBO** | Free | Dutch agent network | Basic listing only |
| **Hoomly** | Free | Agent + individual listings | New, limited coverage |

#### Our Unique Positioning

**Key Differentiator**: We are the ONLY platform providing:
- 30+ government data layers in one place
- Foundation risk assessment (KCAF data)
- Monument status check (Rijksmonumentenregister)
- Livability scores at 100x100m granularity
- Flood risk and environmental data
- Energy efficiency analysis with savings estimates
- Multi-language support for expats (10 languages)
- Ruimtelijke plannen (zoning) integration

No competitor combines location intelligence with property search. Walter Living has transaction data but no location analysis. Funda has listings but no intelligence.

### Our Positioning

**Key Insight**: We provide *location intelligence*, not *bidding advice*. This is complementary to services like Walter Living, not competitive.

**Value Proposition**:
- 30+ data layers in one place (vs. visiting 30+ government sites)
- Risk assessment (flooding, foundation, crime, noise)
- Livability scores at 100x100m granularity
- Travel time calculations
- Multi-language support for expats
- Property-specific insights (WOZ, energy labels)

**Price Ceiling**: Stay below €29/month (Walter Living) since we don't have bidding data

## Renovation Budget Calculator (Pro Feature)

### Purpose
Help buyers estimate renovation costs and ROI for energy improvements - key for making informed decisions about "fixer-uppers"

### Quick Wins Module

| Improvement | Typical Cost | Annual Savings | Payback Period | Subsidy Available |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **LED Lighting** | €100-300 | €50-100 | 1-3 years | No |
| **Smart Thermostat** | €150-400 | €100-200 | 1-3 years | Sometimes |
| **Radiator Foil** | €20-50 | €30-60 | <1 year | No |
| **Draft Strips** | €50-150 | €50-100 | 1-2 years | No |
| **Shower Heat Recovery** | €500-1,500 | €50-150 | 5-10 years | Sometimes |

**Note on Shower Heat Recovery**: This investment only makes sense for properties where residents will spend significant time. Bathrooms and kitchens are the two spaces people most want to customize when making a house feel like home - so heat recovery ROI depends heavily on planned occupancy duration and shower habits.

### Medium Investments

| Improvement | Typical Cost | Annual Savings | Payback Period | Subsidy Available |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **HR++ Glazing** | €3,000-8,000 | €200-400 | 10-20 years | ISDE up to 30% |

| **Better CV Boiler (HR107)** | €1,500-3,000 | €100-300 | 5-15 years | No (phase out) |

## Revenue Projections

| Basic (€4.99) | 500 (5%) | From free | €2,495 |
| Pro (€9.99) | 200 (2%) | From free | €1,998 |

| **Total MRR** | | | **€26,962** |
| **Annual Revenue** | | | **€323,544** |

---

## Pricing Psychology

### Why These Prices Work

1. **€4.99 Basic** - Impulse purchase threshold, "cup of coffee per week"
2. **€9.99 Pro** - Perceived as "under €10", serious but affordable
3. **€14.99 Pro+** - Half of Walter Living, clear value proposition
4. **€24.99 Bidding** - Still under €29 competitor, premium positioning

### Annual Discount Strategy

- 2 months free with annual subscription (16.7% discount)
- Creates commitment, reduces churn
- Better cash flow for operations

### Conversion Strategy (No Free Trial)

We do NOT offer free trials. Instead:
- **Generous free tier**: 5 searches/day lets users experience core value
- **Clear upgrade prompts**: Show what Pro unlocks when users hit limits
- **Feature previews**: Show blurred/locked Pro features with "Upgrade to see"
- **Session-based upsells**: After 3 searches, prompt with "Get unlimited for €4.99"

**Rationale**: Free trials attract tire-kickers who churn. A generous free tier builds habits and shows value before asking for payment.
